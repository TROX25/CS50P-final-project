BIM technology represents a revolution in the construction industry, integrating design, cost,
scheduling, and operational processes into a single, cohesive digital environment. However, it requires
specialists to possess significantly greater competencies than traditional work methods, presenting
both challenges and new career opportunities. The digitalization and automation of construction
processes, expected to intensify in the near future, are transforming the roles of engineers, designers,
and BIM managers, making their expertise crucial to project success. BIM enables simulations and
analysis of potential issues, cost and schedule optimization, and supports data management,
environmental aspects, and facility operation. Thanks to BIM, construction process participants can
collaborate more effectively, minimizing errors and increasing budget accuracy. The implementation
of this technology is not only progress but also a necessity for improving professional qualifications,
which in the long run leads to greater efficiency and cost savings throughout the entire investment lifecycle
In the following study, the key elements of the BIM methodology/technology were first presented.
Then, the advantages and disadvantages of BIM technology were discussed and compared, along with
its potential applications in design, cost, scheduling, and environmental analyses. Additionally, the
challenges related to its implementation and practical use in decision-making processes were
examined. The study also explores the possibilities of using software engineering to automate
processes at every stage of project development.
